# v 1.0.5

Fixed bug with Personal Truths and Injuries on the Actor sheet.
Due to the nature of the bug data model is changed and no migration is provided
If you want to check what truths and injuries that actor previously had you can use a SCRIPT macro that will log those thruths and injuries in the console. If the actor's truths and injuries were corrupted you will see an empty list unfortunately.

Here is a SCRIPT macro (select the actor's token on the stage and click the macro):

```
let act = canvas.tokens.controlled[0]?.actor
if(act == undefined){
console.log('select a token first')
return;
}
console.log("TRUTHS")
console.log(act.data.data.truths)
console.log("INJURIES")
console.log(act.data.data.injuries.list)
```
